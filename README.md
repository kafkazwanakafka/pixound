# pixound
A research project that is to result in a program that is able to transmit pictures over sound waves and interpret them back into pictures. It is meant to test, along the way, different approaches to:
* 2d picture (monochrome or colour) to continuous data transformation
* continuous data to sound transformation
* sound into picture interpretation
